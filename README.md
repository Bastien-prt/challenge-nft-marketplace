NFT Marketplace Challenge !

The goal of this challenge was to realize as quickly as possible the model proposed by Raffialdo Bayu ( https://dribbble.com/shots/16787820-Landing-Page-NFT-Marketplace/attachments/11848395?mode=media ).
The developer and youtuber BenjaminCode did it in 1 hour. On my side, it took me about 2h 30 to finish this challenge.
The code may not be the most optimized and cleanest, but the goal was to make it fast, and pretty.
Don't hesitate to try !
